# Product Roadmap

## ✅ MVP Complete (v0.1.0) - Released 2024-11-11

The following features have been implemented and released:

1. [x] **Template Link Extraction** — Build parser to analyze Django templates and extract all internal links from plain href attributes and {% url %} template tags, storing them with source location information. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `template_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Extracts both href attributes and {% url %} tags
   - ✅ Filters for internal links only

2. [x] **URL Pattern Discovery** — Implement Django URL configuration introspection to discover all defined urlpatterns across the project, including app-level URLs and namespaced patterns. `S`
   - ✅ Implemented in `url_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Handles nested URLResolvers and namespaces
   - ✅ Supports both RoutePattern and RegexPattern

3. [x] **URL Matching Engine** — Create matching system to compare extracted template links against discovered URL patterns, identifying which URLs are referenced and which are orphaned. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `finddeadcode` management command
   - ✅ Identifies unreferenced URL patterns
   - ✅ Cross-references templates and URL patterns

4. [x] **View Reference Tracker** — Link matched URL patterns to their corresponding view functions or class-based views, counting reference frequency across all templates. `S`
   - ✅ Implemented in `url_analyzer.py` and `view_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Maps URLs to view callables
   - ✅ Tracks view-to-template relationships

5. [x] **Template Usage Analysis** — Scan Python view files to find all references to templates via render(), TemplateView, and similar Django patterns to identify which templates are actually used. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `view_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ AST parsing for render() calls
   - ✅ Class-based view template_name detection

6. [x] **Basic CLI Reporter** — Build command-line interface that outputs analysis results showing view reference counts, unused URLs, and orphaned templates in readable text format. `S`
   - ✅ Django management command: `python manage.py finddeadcode`
   - ✅ Console reporter with human-readable output
   - ✅ Summary statistics and warnings

7. [x] **Template Inheritance Tracking** — Extend template parser to follow {% include %} and {% extends %} tags, building complete template dependency graph including nested inheritance. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `template_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Tracks {% include %} tags
   - ✅ Tracks {% extends %} tags
   - ✅ Reports template relationships

## ✅ v0.2.0 Features - Complete (2025-11-12)

8. [x] **Reverse/Redirect Detection** — Implement Python AST analysis to find all reverse() and redirect() calls in view code, capturing programmatic URL references beyond templates. `L`
   - ✅ Implemented in `reverse_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Detects `reverse()`, `reverse_lazy()`, `redirect()`, and `HttpResponseRedirect()` patterns
   - ✅ Handles nested patterns like `HttpResponseRedirect(reverse('url'))`
   - ✅ Detects namespaced URLs (`'myapp:detail'`)
   - ✅ Flags dynamic URL patterns (f-strings, concatenation) for manual review
   - ✅ Integrated with finddeadcode command
   - ✅ 100% code coverage with 20 comprehensive tests
   - ✅ Reduces false positives for URLs referenced only in Python code

## 🚧 In Progress / Planned Features

9. [x] **Multi-App Analysis** — Add support for analyzing Django projects with multiple apps, showing cross-app dependencies and generating per-app reports. `M`
   - ⚠️ Partially implemented
   - ✅ Can filter by specific apps with `--apps` flag
   - ❌ No cross-app dependency visualization yet
   - ❌ No per-app report generation

10. [ ] **Django Admin Detection** — Detect and filter URLs automatically generated by Django admin and common third-party packages to reduce false positives in dead code detection. `S`
    - Not yet started
    - Would improve accuracy for projects using Django admin

11. [ ] **Confidence Scoring System** — Implement confidence levels for dead code detection that account for dynamic URL generation, runtime patterns, and third-party integrations. `M`
    - Not yet started
    - Important for providing actionable insights

12. [x] **Enhanced Report Generation** — Create detailed reporting with multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown) showing relationship visualizations and prioritized cleanup suggestions. `L`
    - ⚠️ Partially implemented
    - ✅ JSON output format
    - ✅ Markdown output format
    - ✅ Console output format
    - ❌ No HTML output with visualizations yet
    - ❌ No prioritized cleanup suggestions
