# Product Roadmap

## ✅ MVP Complete (v0.1.0) - Released 2024-11-11

The following features have been implemented and released:

1. [x] **Template Link Extraction** — Build parser to analyze Django templates and extract all internal links from plain href attributes and {% url %} template tags, storing them with source location information. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `template_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Extracts both href attributes and {% url %} tags
   - ✅ Filters for internal links only

2. [x] **URL Pattern Discovery** — Implement Django URL configuration introspection to discover all defined urlpatterns across the project, including app-level URLs and namespaced patterns. `S`
   - ✅ Implemented in `url_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Handles nested URLResolvers and namespaces
   - ✅ Supports both RoutePattern and RegexPattern

3. [x] **URL Matching Engine** — Create matching system to compare extracted template links against discovered URL patterns, identifying which URLs are referenced and which are orphaned. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `finddeadcode` management command
   - ✅ Identifies unreferenced URL patterns
   - ✅ Cross-references templates and URL patterns

4. [x] **View Reference Tracker** — Link matched URL patterns to their corresponding view functions or class-based views, counting reference frequency across all templates. `S`
   - ✅ Implemented in `url_analyzer.py` and `view_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Maps URLs to view callables
   - ✅ Tracks view-to-template relationships

5. [x] **Template Usage Analysis** — Scan Python view files to find all references to templates via render(), TemplateView, and similar Django patterns to identify which templates are actually used. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `view_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ AST parsing for render() calls
   - ✅ Class-based view template_name detection

6. [x] **Basic CLI Reporter** — Build command-line interface that outputs analysis results showing view reference counts, unused URLs, and orphaned templates in readable text format. `S`
   - ✅ Django management command: `python manage.py finddeadcode`
   - ✅ Console reporter with human-readable output
   - ✅ Summary statistics and warnings

7. [x] **Template Inheritance Tracking** — Extend template parser to follow {% include %} and {% extends %} tags, building complete template dependency graph including nested inheritance. `M`
   - ✅ Implemented in `template_analyzer.py`
   - ✅ Tracks {% include %} tags
   - ✅ Tracks {% extends %} tags
   - ✅ Reports template relationships

## 🚧 In Progress / Planned Features

8. [ ] **Reverse/Redirect Detection** — Implement Python AST analysis to find all reverse() and redirect() calls in view code, capturing programmatic URL references beyond templates. `L`
   - Not yet started
   - High priority for reducing false positives

9. [x] **Multi-App Analysis** — Add support for analyzing Django projects with multiple apps, showing cross-app dependencies and generating per-app reports. `M`
   - ⚠️ Partially implemented
   - ✅ Can filter by specific apps with `--apps` flag
   - ❌ No cross-app dependency visualization yet
   - ❌ No per-app report generation

10. [ ] **Django Admin Detection** — Detect and filter URLs automatically generated by Django admin and common third-party packages to reduce false positives in dead code detection. `S`
    - Not yet started
    - Would improve accuracy for projects using Django admin

11. [ ] **Confidence Scoring System** — Implement confidence levels for dead code detection that account for dynamic URL generation, runtime patterns, and third-party integrations. `M`
    - Not yet started
    - Important for providing actionable insights

12. [x] **Enhanced Report Generation** — Create detailed reporting with multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown) showing relationship visualizations and prioritized cleanup suggestions. `L`
    - ⚠️ Partially implemented
    - ✅ JSON output format
    - ✅ Markdown output format
    - ✅ Console output format
    - ❌ No HTML output with visualizations yet
    - ❌ No prioritized cleanup suggestions

## 📊 Progress Summary

- **Completed:** 7/12 features (58%)
- **Partially Complete:** 2/12 features (17%)
- **Not Started:** 3/12 features (25%)
- **MVP Status:** ✅ Complete (features 1-6)

## 🎯 Next Release (v0.2.0) - Planned

Focus on reducing false positives and improving accuracy:

1. **Reverse/Redirect Detection** (Feature 8)
   - Add AST parsing for `reverse()` calls
   - Detect `redirect()` to URL names
   - Track `HttpResponseRedirect(reverse(...))`

2. **Django Admin Detection** (Feature 10)
   - Auto-detect admin.site URLs
   - Skip common third-party package URLs
   - Configurable exclusion patterns

3. **Enhanced Multi-App Analysis** (Feature 9 completion)
   - Cross-app dependency graph
   - Per-app summary reports
   - Visualization of app relationships
