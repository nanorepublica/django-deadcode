# Product Roadmap

1. [ ] **Template Link Extraction** — Build parser to analyze Django templates and extract all internal links from plain href attributes and {% url %} template tags, storing them with source location information. `M`

2. [ ] **URL Pattern Discovery** — Implement Django URL configuration introspection to discover all defined urlpatterns across the project, including app-level URLs and namespaced patterns. `S`

3. [ ] **URL Matching Engine** — Create matching system to compare extracted template links against discovered URL patterns, identifying which URLs are referenced and which are orphaned. `M`

4. [ ] **View Reference Tracker** — Link matched URL patterns to their corresponding view functions or class-based views, counting reference frequency across all templates. `S`

5. [ ] **Template Usage Analysis** — Scan Python view files to find all references to templates via render(), TemplateView, and similar Django patterns to identify which templates are actually used. `M`

6. [ ] **Basic CLI Reporter** — Build command-line interface that outputs analysis results showing view reference counts, unused URLs, and orphaned templates in readable text format. `S`

7. [ ] **Template Inheritance Tracking** — Extend template parser to follow {% include %} and {% extends %} tags, building complete template dependency graph including nested inheritance. `M`

8. [ ] **Reverse/Redirect Detection** — Implement Python AST analysis to find all reverse() and redirect() calls in view code, capturing programmatic URL references beyond templates. `L`

9. [ ] **Multi-App Analysis** — Add support for analyzing Django projects with multiple apps, showing cross-app dependencies and generating per-app reports. `M`

10. [ ] **Django Admin Detection** — Detect and filter URLs automatically generated by Django admin and common third-party packages to reduce false positives in dead code detection. `S`

11. [ ] **Confidence Scoring System** — Implement confidence levels for dead code detection that account for dynamic URL generation, runtime patterns, and third-party integrations. `M`

12. [ ] **Enhanced Report Generation** — Create detailed reporting with multiple output formats (JSON, HTML, Markdown) showing relationship visualizations and prioritized cleanup suggestions. `L`

> Notes
> - Features 1-6 constitute the MVP for basic dead code analysis
> - Features 7-10 add advanced detection capabilities for comprehensive analysis
> - Features 11-12 focus on improving accuracy and usability of results
> - Each feature includes both backend analysis logic and appropriate test coverage
> - Order reflects technical dependencies: template analysis → URL matching → view linking → advanced features
